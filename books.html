                        <p>Cold and calculating, insurance executive Michael Azodo has built a life on refusing mercy to others. Then he meets Rebecca, a compassionate nurse with shadows behind her smile who breaks through his carefully constructed walls. Their intense romance leads to a happy marriage—until Michael collapses.</p>
                        
                        <p>Hospital tests reveal someone is poisoning him. Evidence points to his beloved wife, but Michael, refusing the police, seeks her hidden motives alone. His investigation uncovers a devastating truth: Rebecca's true identity is tied to a tragedy he caused but cannot remember—one his psychologist mother made him forget.</p>
                        
                        <p>As his health deteriorates alongside his crumbling marriage, Michael confronts who he's been and who he could become. In a race against his failing body, Michael faces the ultimate question: what price is too high for redemption?</p>

                        <p>Ali is a depressed 30-something year old Nigerian with superpowers who long abandoned his youthful superhero ways after a series of monumental losses. A new loss threatens him when his grandfather is diagnosed with a terminal illness, forcing him out of early retirement.</p>
                        
                        <p>Around this time, and against the backdrop of election fever, chaos arrives in Abuja in the form of the Rainmaker, a brutally efficient terrorist whose main victims are top politicians and government officials.</p>
                        
                        <p>When the Senate President’s daughter is kidnapped, he hires Ali to rescue her. Normally not one to work for politicians, desperation forces Ali to take the job, putting him on a collision course with the Rainmaker. What follows will determine the fate of both men—and Nigeria itself.</p>
