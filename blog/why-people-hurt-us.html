            <!-- POST CONTENT -->
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Someone close to you says something cutting. A friend betrays your trust. A partner withdraws when you need them most.</p>

                <p>Your immediate reaction is to take it personally. To assume it says something about you—that you're not worthy of better treatment, that you somehow deserved this.</p>

                <p>But here's what I've learned: when people hurt us, it almost never starts with us.</p>

                <h2>The Hidden Story</h2>

                <p>Every person who's hurt you badly was hurting first. I don't mean this as an excuse for their behavior. I mean it as a fact that changes everything once you see it.</p>

                <p>The parent who was harsh with you? They were raised by harsher parents. The friend who betrayed you? They're terrified of being vulnerable. The partner who withdrew? They learned early that showing need leads to disappointment.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Hurt people hurt people" is a cliché because it's true. But it's not just true—it's liberating once you understand what it means for you.
                </blockquote>

                <p>When someone lashes out at you, they're usually fighting a battle you know nothing about. Their cruelty is their pain looking for somewhere to land. Their coldness is their fear masquerading as strength.</p>

                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

                <p>Understanding this doesn't mean you should accept mistreatment. It doesn't mean you can't set boundaries or walk away from toxic relationships.</p>

                <p>What it means is you can stop carrying their damage as if it's yours.</p>

                <p>When you realize their behavior reflects their wounds—not your worth—something shifts. You stop asking "What's wrong with me?" and start seeing the situation clearly: someone's pain spilled onto you.</p>

                <h3>The Peace That Comes With Understanding</h3>

                <p>Here's the paradox: the moment you stop taking their hurt personally, you become free to respond wisely instead of reactively.</p>

                <p>You can:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Set boundaries without guilt</li>
                    <li>Leave without needing them to admit they were wrong</li>
                    <li>Forgive without forgetting the lesson</li>
                    <li>Show compassion while still protecting yourself</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This is what peace of mind looks like—not pretending the hurt didn't happen, but seeing it for what it actually is.</p>

                <h2>What About You?</h2>

                <p>Now here's the harder part: if hurt people hurt people, then you've probably hurt others too. Not because you're a bad person, but because you were carrying your own pain.</p>

                <p>Understanding this about yourself is as important as understanding it about others. Maybe you were impatient with someone because you were exhausted. Maybe you withdrew because you were afraid. Maybe you lashed out because you felt cornered.</p>

                <p>The same compassion you're learning to extend to others? You deserve it too.</p>

                <h2>Moving Forward</h2>

                <p>This understanding doesn't erase what happened. The hurt was real, even if it wasn't about you. The betrayal still happened, even if they were acting from their own pain.</p>

                <p>But now you have something more valuable than revenge or vindication: clarity. You understand that their behavior revealed their brokenness, not your inadequacy. And that understanding sets you free to heal without needing them to change first.</p>

                <p>That's the real gift of understanding—it breaks the chain. Their pain doesn't have to become yours. Their wounds don't have to define your worth.</p>

                <p>You get to be your best self anyway.</p>
