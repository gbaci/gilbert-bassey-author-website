                <p>Anxiety appears. Your immediate instinct: make it stop. Scroll. Eat. Call someone. Binge a show. Do anything to escape the feeling.</p>

                <p>Anger rises. Your reflex: express it immediately or stuff it down. Lash out or shut down. But never just... feel it.</p>

                <p>Sadness shows up uninvited. Your solution: positive thinking. Gratitude lists. Anything to push it away before it settles in.</p>

                <p>We've become masters at running from our own emotions.</p>

                <h2>What We're Actually Running From</h2>

                <p>It's not the emotion itself that scares us. It's what we think the emotion means.</p>

                <p>Anxiety must mean something terrible is about to happen. Anger must mean we're losing control. Sadness must mean something's wrong with us. Loneliness must mean we're unlovable.</p>

                <p>So we run. We distract. We numb. We do anything except the one thing that actually helps: just sitting with it.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "The emotion that finds no outlet in tears may cause other organs to weep." — Henry Maudsley had it right. What you don't feel doesn't disappear—it just finds other ways to hurt you.
                </blockquote>

                <h2>What Sitting With It Actually Means</h2>

                <p>It's not about wallowing or drowning in the feeling. It's simpler than that:</p>

                <p>Notice the emotion. Name it. Feel where it lives in your body. Don't try to fix it or understand it or make it go away. Just acknowledge: "This is anxiety. It's here right now. It won't kill me."</p>

                <p>That's it. That's the whole practice.</p>

                <p>And here's what happens when you do this consistently: the emotion peaks, then passes. Every single time. Because emotions are like waves—they build, crest, and fade. But only if you let them.</p>

                <h3>What You Discover</h3>

                <p>When you stop running from discomfort, you learn things the running was preventing you from seeing:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The feeling has information.</strong> Your anxiety might be telling you something actually does need attention. Your anger might be showing you a boundary was crossed. Your sadness might be grieving something that deserves to be mourned.</li>
                    <li><strong>You're stronger than you thought.</strong> You can handle the feeling. It's uncomfortable, sure. But uncomfortable isn't dangerous. You won't break.</li>
                    <li><strong>The feeling isn't you.</strong> You're not your anxiety. You're not your anger. You're the one experiencing these things. There's a distance there, and that distance is freedom.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why This Is Hard</h2>

                <p>Our entire culture is built on emotional avoidance. We're taught to "stay positive," "move on," "get over it." We're given a thousand ways to numb out and told they're self-care.</p>

                <p>Social media when you're anxious. Food when you're sad. Shopping when you're empty. Alcohol when you're stressed. Netflix when you're lonely. Work when you're afraid of what you'd feel if you stopped.</p>

                <p>These aren't solutions. They're sedatives. And the cost of constant sedation is that you never build capacity for discomfort. You never learn that feelings are survivable.</p>

                <p>So the feelings grow larger, more frightening. The avoidance becomes more elaborate. The gap between who you are and who you could be gets wider.</p>

                <h2>The Practice</h2>

                <p>Start small. Next time a difficult emotion shows up:</p>

                <p><strong>Pause.</strong> Before you reach for your phone or the fridge or whatever your usual escape is, just stop.</p>

                <p><strong>Breathe.</strong> Three slow breaths. In for four counts, out for six. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system—your body's natural calming mechanism.</p>

                <p><strong>Name it.</strong> "This is anxiety." "This is grief." "This is shame." Naming reduces the emotion's intensity by engaging the logical part of your brain.</p>

                <p><strong>Locate it.</strong> Where do you feel it in your body? Chest? Throat? Stomach? Just notice.</p>

                <p><strong>Stay.</strong> Don't try to change it. Don't try to understand it yet. Just be with it for 60 seconds. That's all.</p>

                <p>Then, if you still need distraction, fine. But you've done the important work—you didn't run immediately. You proved to yourself you can handle it.</p>

                <h2>What Changes</h2>

                <p>Over time, something remarkable happens. The emotions that used to derail you start to lose their power. Not because they stop coming—they don't. But because you're no longer afraid of them.</p>

                <p>You stop needing to control everything because you know you can handle whatever feelings come up. You stop avoiding difficult conversations because you're not afraid of the discomfort. You stop settling for less because you're willing to feel the loneliness of waiting for better.</p>

                <p>This is what emotional maturity actually is—not the absence of difficult feelings, but the capacity to experience them without being controlled by them.</p>

                <p>It's what peace of mind looks like when you're honest about it. Not constant happiness. Not the absence of pain. Just the quiet confidence that whatever you feel, you can sit with it until it passes.</p>

                <p>And it always passes. Always.</p>
