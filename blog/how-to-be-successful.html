                <p>everyone wants to know the secret to success. they're looking for the hack, the shortcut, the one weird trick that separates the winners from everyone else. but i think most people are asking the wrong question.</p>

                <p>success isn't about having the perfect strategy or never making mistakes. it's not about being the smartest person in the room or having all the answers. it's simpler than that, and harder too.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    resilience is the ability to pick yourself back up and go again after you fall.
                </blockquote>

                <p>that's it. that's the whole thing.</p>

                <h2>everyone falls</h2>

                <p>the people you admire, the ones who've built something, achieved something, become something—they're not special because they never failed. they're special because they failed and kept going anyway.</p>

                <p>they got rejected and sent another pitch. they lost money and started over. they embarrassed themselves and showed up again the next day. they fell flat on their face, stayed down for a minute, and then got back up.</p>

                <p>because here's what nobody tells you: failure is guaranteed. you're going to mess up. you're going to fall short. you're going to try something that doesn't work. the only question is what you do next.</p>

                <h2>the difference is what happens after</h2>

                <p>there are two types of people. the ones who fall and decide it means something about them—that they're not good enough, not smart enough, not meant for this. and the ones who fall and decide it means they need to try again.</p>

                <p>the first group quits. not always immediately, but eventually. they let the failure confirm their worst fears about themselves, and they stop trying. the second group? they keep going. not because they're braver or more talented, but because they've made a different choice about what failure means.</p>

                <p>they see it as data, not destiny. as feedback, not a verdict. as part of the process, not proof that they should give up.</p>

                <h2>going again</h2>

                <p>i wrote a song called "OH OH" about this exact feeling. it's about that moment when everything goes wrong, when you're down and it would be so easy to stay there. but then something in you says: one more time. let's go again.</p>

                <p>that voice—the one that says "go again"—is the difference. it's not loud or dramatic. it doesn't make falling hurt less. but it shows up anyway, after every loss, and it asks: what now?</p>

                <p>and if you listen to it enough times, if you keep getting up even when it feels pointless, something shifts. you start to trust yourself. not because you're winning all the time, but because you know you can handle losing and still be okay.</p>

                <h2>success is a practice</h2>

                <p>success isn't a moment. it's not the day you finally make it, when everything clicks into place and stays there forever. it's a practice. it's the accumulation of all the times you could have quit and didn't. all the times you felt like giving up but chose to try one more time instead.</p>

                <p>so if you want to be successful, stop waiting for the perfect plan or the right moment. stop looking for the one thing that will make it easy. just start. and when you fall—because you will—get back up. and do it again.</p>

                <p>that's the whole thing. that's the secret. resilience. the ability to keep going when it's hard, when it hurts, when you're not sure it's going to work.</p>

                <p>because eventually, if you stay in the game long enough, it does.</p>
