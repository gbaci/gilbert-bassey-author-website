            <!-- POST CONTENT -->
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>we're told from a young age that we all have a purpose. that there's some grand plan written into the fabric of the universe with our name on it, and our job is to find it. to discover what we were "meant" to do.</p>

                <p>it's a comforting idea. it suggests that somewhere out there, there's a perfect life waiting for us, and if we just search hard enough, ask the right questions, follow the right signs, we'll stumble upon it. and then everything will make sense.</p>

                <p>but here's the uncomfortable truth: there is no predetermined purpose waiting for you to find it.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    purpose isn't something you find, it's something you create.
                </blockquote>

                <h2>the myth of destiny</h2>

                <p>the idea that we all have a pre-written destiny is appealing because it takes the pressure off. if there's one right path, then all we have to do is figure out what it is and follow it. we're not responsible for making the wrong choice because there's only one right one.</p>

                <p>but that's not how life works. there's no cosmic blueprint. no predetermined plot. you weren't born to do one specific thing and only that thing. you were born with potential, with curiosity, with the capacity to choose—and that's both terrifying and liberating.</p>

                <p>because if there's no script, then you have to write it. and that means you also have to take responsibility for what you write.</p>

                <h2>you are the author, not a character</h2>

                <p>most people go through life like they're characters in someone else's story, waiting for the plot to reveal itself. they're passive, reactive, looking for external validation that they're on the "right path." and when things feel meaningless or directionless, they assume they just haven't found their purpose yet.</p>

                <p>but what if the point isn't to find anything? what if the point is to decide?</p>

                <blockquote>
                    you are the author of your story, not just a character following a script.
                </blockquote>

                <p>this means you get to choose what matters to you. you get to decide what your life is about. not based on what you think you're "supposed" to do, or what would impress other people, or what some imaginary future version of yourself would want—but based on what feels true and meaningful to you right now.</p>

                <p>and here's the thing: you can change your mind. you can rewrite the story. you can decide that what mattered to you five years ago doesn't anymore, and that's okay. because you're not locked into some pre-existing narrative. you're making it up as you go.</p>

                <h2>the freedom in uncertainty</h2>

                <p>i know this is uncomfortable. it would be easier if there were a clear answer, a roadmap, a guarantee that if you just do the right things in the right order, you'll end up where you're supposed to be.</p>

                <p>but the flip side of that uncertainty is freedom. if there's no one right path, then there are infinite possibilities. if you're not trying to fulfill some cosmic destiny, then you can pursue what genuinely excites you, not what you think you're obligated to care about.</p>

                <p>you can try things and let them go. you can build a life around what you love today and trust that if that changes tomorrow, you'll adapt. you don't have to have it all figured out because there's nothing to figure out—there's only what you choose to build.</p>

                <h2>creating your purpose</h2>

                <p>so how do you create purpose? you start by asking different questions.</p>

                <p>not "what am i meant to do?" but "what do i want to do?"</p>

                <p>not "what's my calling?" but "what calls to me right now?"</p>

                <p>not "what's my destiny?" but "what kind of life do i want to create?"</p>

                <p>and then you act. you make choices. you commit to things even without certainty. you build something, knowing it might not last forever, and you let that be okay.</p>

                <p>because purpose isn't a destination you arrive at. it's something you practice. it's the meaning you bring to your work, your relationships, your daily life. it's what you decide matters, and then the way you show up for it.</p>

                <h2>the uncomfortable freedom</h2>

                <p>there's no pre-written story. no cosmic plan. no one right answer. just you, your choices, and the life you build from them.</p>

                <p>that's the uncomfortable truth. but it's also the most liberating one.</p>

                <p>you are the author. so write something worth reading.</p>
