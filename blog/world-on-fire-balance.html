                <p>the world is on fire and only balance will save it.</p>

                <p>a pretty big claim but hear me out.</p>

                <p>never in the history of humankind have we been so polarized. some say that science and technology are to blame, but they are only enablers, not the root cause. at the center of this is the universe and its core operating principle — duality.</p>

                <p>when you consider your existence, do you not get the sense that you are living within a dance of opposites? life spells death, good calls bad into existence, night desires day, male craves female.</p>

                <p>it is fascinating when you also consider that the atom, minute as it is, contains opposites. more interesting is the fact that these electrons and protons are in an eternal dance.</p>

                <p>how does one survive in such a world, for if one must be good, then the other must be bad? if democracy is good, socialism must be bad. if life is good, it follows that death must be bad, and so we go around dreading it. if pleasure is desirable, then we must avoid pain at all costs. if profit is healthy, then loss is a sickness we must guard against, even to the detriment of mother earth.</p>

                <p>if you pay close attention, you will see that the root of the world's problems is a lack of understanding.</p>

                <p>we do not grasp the importance of balance. this article explains why balance is the key to saving ourselves from suffering and how we can use it.</p>

                <h2>the curse of imbalance</h2>

                <blockquote>
                    we cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being more sensitive to pain. — Alan Watts, The Wisdom of Insecurity
                </blockquote>

                <p>it is an innate desire in us to find things we like, either an object, a state of mind, an identity, a way of life, or a worldview. then comes the desire to keep it frozen in surety and adhered to at all times. followed by a desire to defend and advocate for it (in the case of religion, identity, way of life). if we lose it (in the case of a state of mind, objects), we go in search of it with much fervor. someway somehow, we end up taking it all the way to its extreme.</p>

                <p>in the history of humanity, extremism has created mankind's most devastating events. suicide is the mind taking the road of despair to its extreme. murder is anger and hate taking their road to the ultimate end. global warming is capitalism taking itself on its innovative ride to the extreme. obesity is a love for junk food going over and beyond.</p>

                <p>whichever way you look at it, the extremes seem to come along with some consequences. we attempt to chase happiness all the time and find that we somehow end up with anxiety and some curious habits. we attempt to instill stability in life but end up creating fragile systems. we try to control our thoughts and find that we become slaves to them.</p>

                <p>viewed this way, our greatest problems arise from a desire to control reality with the express intent of eliminating the unwanted opposite. capitalism gets so high off profit that in its desire to gain more and more, it becomes evil. all because it won't let the other side, loss, come along.</p>

                <p>what is the antidote to this malady? simple, balance. but this is hardly saying anything. to convince you how balance fixes it all, let us look at it from two distinct points of view.</p>

                <h2>why is balance the answer?</h2>

                <h3>the interdependence of opposites</h3>

                <blockquote>
                    all explicit opposites are implicit allies — correlative in the sense that they "go with" each other and cannot exist apart. — Alan Watts, The Book
                </blockquote>

                <p>the concept of interdependence of opposites says that, though opposites may seem like they don't belong together, this is only an illusion. in truth, they go together as night follows day, and death answers life.</p>

                <p>this may seem impossible to believe, but there is no further need to convince you. all i need do is point you to life. have you found any opposite that does not go with the other? how do you understand pain if you do not have pleasure to compare it with?</p>

                <p>this never-ending dance of opposites has been going on for far longer than we can imagine. without bad, we can't recognize good. hence, good cannot go without bad.</p>

                <h3>the inevitability of the other</h3>

                <p>carl jung termed it enantiodromia. the dictionary defines it as a tendency for things to change to their opposites.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    …the attainment of any extreme position is the point where it begins to turn into its own opposite — a process that can be dreary and repetitious without the realization that opposite extremes are polar, and that poles need each other. — Alan Watts, The Book
                </blockquote>

                <p>this is quite like the interdependence of opposites but takes it a bit further, almost like a plot twist. when things swing too far out of balance to one side — as in, good has been winning for a long time — bad must come as a result. this is quite different from the fact that opposites go together. it states that if things have been good for a long time, bad must come. further, if life has been lived for a long time, death must come.</p>

                <p>a revolutionary, certain of his destiny to rid his country of oppression, wages war. in his surety, he does everything and anything, damning the consequences. at the end of the day, he will be slapped by surprise when he finds that he has become an oppressor.</p>

                <h2>how to attain balance</h2>

                <p>having understood why balance is the answer, how do we then instill balance? i explore two ways below, posited by two great thinkers.</p>

                <h3>1. Nassim Taleb and the safety of antifragility — the balance of actions and views</h3>

                <blockquote>
                    a little bit of an otherwise offending substance, not too much, acts to benefit the organism and make it better overall as it triggers some overreaction — Nassim Taleb, Antifragile
                </blockquote>

                <p>fragility is the quality of a thing to be easily destroyed when stressed. antifragility is its quality to not be destroyed but to get stronger with each exposure to stress.</p>

                <p>we create fragility by striving for stability in an unstable world. when you desire only one thing and pursue it to its extreme, or you think only one thing and follow it to its extreme, you create fragility in your mind.</p>

                <p>an ecosystem becomes fragile when it panders to the desires of only one creature. by trying to eradicate islamic terrorism no matter the cost, the anti-terrorists create more terrorists.</p>

                <p>it should be easy for you to see why when you accept that life is an eternal dance between opposites. the nature of the dance dictates that you do not try to obliterate the other at all costs. attempting this creates a bigger explosion than you may have intended. thus, the wise thing is to learn to live with instability.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    you get pseudo-order when you seek order; you only get a measure of order and control when you embrace randomness. — Nassim Taleb, Antifragile
                </blockquote>

                <p>when you strive for a balance between two opposites, you instill antifragility.</p>

                <p>once a democrat follows his democratic principles to the end, seeking only the establishment of that which he deems fit and doing his best to take out the opposition no matter the cost, the country becomes fragile.</p>

                <p>this is because the inevitable result is a violent reaction on the other side. not violent only in the sense of violence, but rather, violent in the nature/scale of the reaction. but if the democrat is willing to listen to the republican and concede on certain points, antifragility is restored.</p>

                <p>it is the nature of life that in this dance, when things are taken too seriously, catastrophe follows. when the atom's electron and proton were forced apart above hiroshima, catastrophe ensued.</p>

                <p>isn't it curious that dividing the basic forces within all things caused a massive explosion? it is as if life is showing with clear proof that opposites go together. further, any attempt to separate the two will always result in extreme consequences.</p>

                <p>hence, we must balance our actions and be willing to let the other side in.</p>

                <h3>2. Alan Watts and the wisdom of insecurity — the balance of desires</h3>

                <blockquote>
                    in times of happiness and pleasure, we are usually ready enough to be aware of the moment, and to let the experience be all. in such moments we "forget ourselves," and the mind makes no attempt to divide itself from itself, to be separate from experience. but with the arrival of pain, whether physical or emotional, whether actual or anticipated, the split begins and the circle goes round and round. — Alan Watts, Wisdom of Insecurity
                </blockquote>

                <p>when it comes to our desires, we apportion all to half of life, the good half. happiness, joy, health, wealth, kindness, patience, success, etc.</p>

                <p>while we wholeheartedly desire this half, we double-wholeheartedly dread the other half. in that other half reside all life's agents of insecurity. we so dread insecurity that we are willing to trade anything to run away from it.</p>

                <p>but as we have seen now, life is a dance of the desired half and the undesired half. hence, one must be willing to accept both. to try to avoid one, especially always and at all costs, will create more problems. according to alan watts, there is wisdom in insecurity. this wisdom lay in realizing that man cannot live life without confronting insecurity because that is the nature of the universe. the question then becomes, how can one actually be content with insecurity, pain, anger, sadness, etc.?</p>

                <p>herein lies the crux of the matter. to stand face to face with insecurity is still not to understand it.</p>

                <p>understanding comes through awareness. can we, then, approach our experience — our sensations, feelings, and thoughts — quite simply, as if we had never known them before, and, without prejudice, look at what is going on? you may ask, "which experiences, which sensations and feelings, shall we look at?" i will answer, "which ones can you look at?" the answer is that you must look at the ones you have now.</p>

                <p>that is surely rather obvious. but very obvious things are often overlooked. if a feeling is not present, you are not aware of it. there is no experience but present experience. what you know, what you are actually aware of, is just what is happening at this moment, and no more.</p>

                <p>what alan says is counterintuitive. i still recall when i first read it. i kept wondering how i was supposed to be one with my anger. wouldn't that make me angry for longer? wouldn't accepting my sadness lead me to depression? i didn't expect his advice to work, but boy was i wrong.</p>

                <p>i found that accepting my sadness didn't mean sinking into depression, but rather, being one with my experience. this led me to find out exactly what was making me sad far faster than if i kept running.</p>

                <p>also, a curious thing happens when you accept your negative feelings. sadness doesn't feel so bad anymore. the same goes for anger. instead, the suffering associated with them fades.</p>

                <h2>conclusion</h2>

                <p>a proper understanding of the nature of the universe and its laws somewhat forces us to accept balance as the only true solution to most of the problems we face.</p>

                <p>if profit balances itself with loss for the benefit of mankind, we won't be in such a fragile situation. if hope balances itself with cynicism, it can make more rational decisions that do not get it killed. if i balance my pursuit of happiness with the reality of sadness, i won't be miserable when i'm not happy. if we balance our desire to be heard with the desire of the other side to also be heard (regardless of the argument), we can more easily live in harmony.</p>

                <p>this doesn't mean there won't be conflict. the universal law states that where there is peace, there must be conflict. but by seeing the other side and allowing them in, we limit the scale of the conflict and the casualties. by striving for balance, we get closer to a happier life.</p>
