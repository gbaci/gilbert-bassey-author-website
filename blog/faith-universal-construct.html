                <p>as an addict of meaning, i've always been obsessed with the question "what does it mean?…yes, but what does it really mean?"</p>

                <p>i found over time that we as a society take a lot of things for granted, and one of those things is faith. faith is the knowledge of things that aren't evident. it differs from hope in that hope acknowledges the possibility of the thing not being attained.</p>

                <p>most people will tell you faith is bound to religion, but this is wrong in my opinion. faith is a universal construct. it does not belong to a religion.</p>

                <p>many people don't know it, but they have faith that the sun will rise again literally and metaphorically. or that rain will return next year. and that has nothing to do with religion.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    faith is the knowledge of things that aren't evident.
                </blockquote>

                <p>the reason faith is consistently linked to religion is that faith is a passenger in need of a vehicle. most humans cannot access the power of faith unless it is coated in the vehicle of religion. but a man can have faith in the natural order — a belief that although the universe is chaotic, there is also order in this chaos.</p>

                <p>to illustrate this point, consider: how is it that life exists? how can opposites work together towards a grander purpose? you can theorize all you want, but the fact of the matter is that life exists and that whatever made it start is still working to this day, and will likely work forever more. thus, if you are gonna have faith in anything, isn't it helpful to have faith in that which created you — the universe as-is? this is where the misunderstanding of faith as a religious component begins.</p>

                <p>but why?</p>

                <p>because we are not paying attention to the real meaning of things. rather, we take them for granted. or worse yet, are blinded by misunderstanding.</p>

                <p>many people don't know it, but they have faith that the sun will rise again. or that rain will return next year. and that has nothing to do with religion.</p>

                <p>now, don't misunderstand this as me criticizing religious faith. while i do not subscribe to it, i'm reasonable enough to understand that everyone is free to believe what they want.</p>

                <p>my purpose is to further the idea that faith is not religion-dependent. this is important because i believe that we need faith to live a fulfilling or at the least, content life away from infinite worries.</p>

                <p>i have explored this topic of faith in a few songs. but by far my most poignant song about this brand of faith is step into the light. this is a song about a depressed boy who is trapped in darkness and can't see the light.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    i'm lost inside the dark…<br>
                    damn, i cannot see…<br>
                    but i feel the light…<br>
                    yeah, i cannot see it…<br>
                    but i can feel it…<br>
                    so i step into the light…
                </blockquote>

                <p>to step into the light when you are trapped in darkness is, in a sense, to take a leap of faith.</p>
