            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Zidane was arguably the greatest footballer of his generation. he won the 1998 World Cup for France, scoring two headers in the final to bring the country its first ever trophy. he also won the Champions League and the Ballon d'Or, football's most coveted award. by 2006, he was 34, had come out of international retirement for one last tournament, and had carried France through it almost single-handedly. the 2006 World Cup Final against Italy was his last ever match. the whole world was watching him say goodbye.</p>

                <p>in the 110th minute, with the score level and penalties approaching, Materazzi said something to him. reportedly insulted his mother and sister. Zidane turned around and astonished the world with a headbutt to Materazzi's chest. the world gasped!</p>

                <p>a red card followed, sending Zidane off the pitch, past the World Cup trophy, and into the tunnel. the fairy tale was over. France later lost on penalties.</p>

                <h2>the gap</h2>

                <p>stop to think about this moment.</p>

                <p>Zidane's feeling was valid - a man was disrespecting his family on the biggest stage in the world. but the response cost him the game, the trophy, and the glorious ending he'd earned. that's the thing about the space between what you feel and what you do with it. skip it, and the response takes more from you than the original offense ever did.</p>

                <p>we don't headbutt people on football pitches. but we do the same thing in quieter ways. a sharp word in an argument. a text sent before we've cooled down. we hurt people not because of what we feel, but because of what we do with the feelings before we've had time to think.</p>

                <p>anger wants to act fast. it doesn't wait for you to choose your words. it doesn't care about context or proportion. it just moves. and by the time you've caught up to it, the thing has already been said.</p>

                <h2>what i've learned</h2>

                <p>you can be right about how you feel and still be wrong about what you did. holding both of those truths is uncomfortable, but it's the only honest position.</p>

                <p>if you skip the pause, if you let the anger speak before you can gain control, you will almost always say more than you meant, louder than you needed to, to someone who didn't deserve the full weight of it.</p>

                <p>feel what you feel, but choose what you do with it, because the feeling passes and what you said in its name doesn't.</p>

                <p class="comment-invitation">was Zidane right to act on his feelings that way? do you think it was worth it? what would you have done? more importantly, do you think it's even possible to choose wisely when you're feeling it that strongly? i'd love to read your thoughts in the comments.</p>
